'''
Convolutional Neural Networks: Step by Step

Welcome to Course 4's first assignment! In this assignment, you will implement convolutional (CONV) and pooling (POOL) layers in numpy, including both forward propagation and (optionally) backward propagation.

By the end of this notebook, you'll be able to:

    Explain the convolution operation
    Apply two different types of pooling operation
    Identify the components used in a convolutional neural network (padding, stride, filter, ...) and their purpose
    Build a convolutional neural network

'''
The pooling (POOL) layer reduces the height and width of the input. It helps reduce computation, as well as helps make feature detectors more invariant to its position in the input. The two types of pooling layers are:

    Max-pooling layer: slides an (ùëì,ùëì) window over the input and stores the max value of the window in the output.
    Average-pooling layer: slides an (ùëì,ùëì) window over the input and stores the average value of the window in the output.
    
These pooling layers have no parameters for backpropagation to train. However, they have hyperparameters such as the 
window size ùëì. This specifies the height and width of the ùëì√óùëì window you would compute a max or average over.
